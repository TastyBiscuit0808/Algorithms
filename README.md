# Algorithms

This repository is a collection of algorithms implemented in C. 
It aims to provide developers with a comprehensive set of algorithms that they can use as reference, learn from, and integrate into their own projects.

The algorithms in this repository cover a wide range of categories, including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, 
string algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. Each algorithm is implemented with a clear and concise approach, 
making it easy for developers of all levels to understand.

Thank You
